Dear --,

I hope this email finds you well.

I just came across your website and was wondering if you're in need of any coding assistance for your website?

I'm a Shopify Expert ranked top #10 most helpful member in the Shopify Forum ( my profile: https://bit.ly/33qG04p ), I'm also actively working with clients running large Shopify stores (10k+ daily visits).

I'm more than happy to hop on a quick Google Meets call or chat via email to discuss in further details.

Thanks for your time!

Hi,

I noticed your website's performance is low:

I'm a certified Shopify Expert ( here is my profile: https://bit.ly/33qG04p ), currently the top #4 most liked author at the Shopify forum. (Rank: https://bit.ly/shopifyforum ).

I can help you get that fixed. Are you available for a quick call this week?

Thanks :)

Regards,
Diego

Hi,

I see a few things that could be improved with your Shopify {theme} theme, would this be the owner's email to send a Google Docs review?

I'm a certified Shopify Expert ( my profile: https://bit.ly/33qG04p ), also top #4 most liked author at Shopify's forum ( https://bit.ly/shopifyforum ).

As someone working with Shopify merchants for years 8+ years and also running my own shop, I understand you get similar emails like this all the time, so I'm happy to hop on a quick 10 mins call if you're available this week. No strings attached at all.

Thank you for your time, wishing you a great day!

Dear {name} team,

I hope you're having a nice {weekday}!

I have a few suggestions & feedback about your Shopify store to improve its UX and CRO, which email address would it be the appropriate one to send it to?

I am a certified Shopify Expert (https://bit.ly/33qG04p), top #4 all time most liked author on Shopify's forum (https://bit.ly/shopifyforum). 

To make it clear, it's not anything automated (your site is captcha protected), just a genuine reach out. 
I realize you likely receive many emails like this, I won't be contacting you again if this goes unanswered. 

Thank you for your time and patience!

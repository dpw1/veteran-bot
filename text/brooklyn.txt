Dear {name} team,

I noticed that you're using the {theme} theme. My name is Diego, I'm a certified Shopify Partner and the top #10 most active member in the official Shopify Forum. ( my profile: https://bit.ly/33qG04p )

I make code snippets for Shopify themes that can replace apps, just by copy/pasting into any theme. They load faster than any apps and also last for life (no subscriptions).

Some of them work particularly well with the {theme} theme, like this one that adds arrows/swiping to the product page (password: 123):

If you'd like to this or anything else free of charge, let me know. You can reach out to me via email or the Shopify Forum. No String attached.

Friendly reminder: this is not an automated message (the website is captcha protected), you won't be hearing from me again.

Thank you very much, I appreciate your time and your patience.

Kind regards,
Diego
